# MySqlDataBase

In this application, I have imported two files, one table each, Top1000Songs and TopAlbums to create two databases, then created node code to search and compare these two databases with each other.

There is a distinction between a database and a table.      
*  Tables live in databases.
*  A table is a set of rows and columns. 

# Built with
